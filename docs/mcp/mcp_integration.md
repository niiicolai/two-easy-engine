# Integration

TwoEasyEngine can be used to create HTML canvas drawings directly within your MCP server. By integrating it as a tool, you can leverage the full capabilities of 2D graphics: animations, shapes, text, and images; while responding to commands from your MCP clients. This allows for dynamic visual content generation on the server side, which can then be sent to clients as images.

The integration process involves setting up TwoEasyEngine to work in a Node.js environment, including configuring global canvas types and creating canvas instances using the canvas library. Once set up, you can register a drawing tool with your MCP server.

For more information about MCP, its concepts, and getting started with your own server, visit the official MCP documentation: [modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

The next page will demonstrate how to add TwoEasyEngine as a tool to an MCP server and introduce a sample project server, which is available on GitHub. This example provides a working setup that you can explore, modify, and extend for your own projects.
