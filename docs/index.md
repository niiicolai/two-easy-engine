**TwoEasyEngine** is a lightweight 2D rendering library built on HTML5 Canvas.
It provides a clean, object-oriented API for creating interactive scenes, managing meshes, controlling cameras, and animating objects, with minimal setup.

### Features

- **Meshes with geometry and materials**: Easily create shapes like Rectangles and Circles.
- **Texture2D support**: Use images in materials to display patterns beyond solid colors.
- **Vector transformations**: Manipulate position, rotation, and scale with ease.
- **Camera2D support**: Control position, rotation, and zoom for dynamic scenes.
- **Scene management**: Organize and render multiple 2D objects efficiently.
- **Offscreen canvas support**: Use the library with an offscreen canvas in a Worker thread. 
- **Simple animation loop**: Built-in `requestAnimationFrame` wrapper for easy management.
- **TypeScript ready**: Modern JavaScript with type declarations for IDE autocompletion.
